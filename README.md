OVERVIEW
========

This repository contains **core** pkgsrc collection: build scripts and
files for the packages required to create a basic Zeppe-Lin system.

This distribution was originally forked from CRUX ports as of version
3.6 and rewritten in POSIX `sh(1p)`.  Also, the Zeppe-Lin has its own
criteria for what packages should be in **core** collection.

The original sources can be downloaded from:
