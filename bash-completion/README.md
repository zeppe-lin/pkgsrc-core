README for bash-completion

POST-INSTALL
============

The easiest way to use bash-completion is to source it from either
`/etc/bashrc` or `~/.bashrc` (or any other file sourcing those).
You can do this by simply adding the following line:

```
. /etc/bash_completion
```

You can also put additional init code into `~/.bash_completion`.
