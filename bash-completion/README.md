POST-INSTALL
============

The easiest way to use bash-completion is to source it from either
`/etc/bashrc` or `~/.bashrc` (or any other file sourcing those).  You can do
this by simply adding the following line:

    . /etc/bash_completion

You can also put additional init code into `~/.bash_completion`.
