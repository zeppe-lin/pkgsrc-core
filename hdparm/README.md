NOTES
=====

It is possible to make the ext3 filesystem reliable across power failures for
some hard disk types.  To do this, add the `barrier=1` mount option to the
appropriate entry in `/etc/fstab`.  To check if the disk drive supports this
option, run hdparm on the applicable disk drive.  For example, if the following
command returns non-empty output, the option is supported:

    hdparm -I /dev/sda | grep NCQ

**IMPORTANT:**
The Logical Volume Management (LVM) based partitions cannot use the barrier
option.
